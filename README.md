# Route-manager-for-AIRAC
If you have AIRAC and use Boeing 757/767 or A319/A321 neo, it might be problematic with approaches - they are simply bugged in those aircrafts. This is the file which exactly changes all approaches to default ones, so you can still use STARs and SIDs flying those planes.
To install, put the 'gui' folder to your FlightGear data directory and replace a file.
